Alchemy is very usefull and profitable skill, which doesn't require any other skills to work,
thats why you can simple make a new char just with alchemy skill, or even train it on pvp char.
For training [Poisoning][2], Alchemy is very handly, let you train the skill a lot cheaper.
If you think about Alchemist profession for serious, you should focus on empty kegs and regs.
Kegs can be crafted by [Carpentry][3] and [Tinkering][4]. Regs are also easy to get, there is a few sources,
buying them from a NCP vendor, buying them from other players or Harvesting them youself with [Lumberjacking][5] skill,
Alchemy skill is also needed to turn raw regs into ready to use regs (every 10% of Alchemy let you make one regent from raw reg,
so with 100% of Alchemy you make 10 regents from one raw reg, there is no bonus above GM Alchemy).
