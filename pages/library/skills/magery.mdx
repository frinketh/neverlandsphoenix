Magery skill is the most usefull skill in the whole game, mainly used for casting spells such as: Recall, Gate Travel, Protection, Bless ... (there are 64 Spells placed in 8 circles). For casting spells you need a spellbook & scrolls, reagents and mana, mana is an energy which depends on your Intelligence (50 int = 50 mana) every circle takes different amount of mana (from 4 to 50), once you cast a spell and lose your mana, you can regenerate by using [Meditation][1] skill, without Meditation skill mana regen very slowly. Scrolls can be found in [Monster Loot][2] or bought from Scribe NPC and all possible scrolls can be created by [Inscription][3] skill. The scrolls have two types of use, first you can just double click the scroll to cast a spell, it doesn't require any reagents, but then your scroll have just one use, after you cast a spell its scroll dissappears. Second way is placing a scroll inside Spellbook and it stays there permanently, you can cast unlimited amount of this spell now, but you need the reagents, you'll find the reagents at NPC Mages, Alchemists or you can harvest them (at least 50% [Lumberjacking][4] skill needed). As new player you should buy full spellbook from other players/vendors, it's much easier at the beggining, full spellbook costs about 20k gp, an empty spellbook can be found at Scribe NPC vendor. To make your spells stronger you should have also [Evaluating Intelligence][5] skill. And the last part, Magery skill lets craft [Magic Items][6], at least 80% of the Magery mixed with [Tinkering][7] lets craft randomly magic jewels and with [Tailoring][8] magic clothes. 

**Note:** Having more Magery makes your spells stronger, same goes with [Evaluating Intelligence][5].
