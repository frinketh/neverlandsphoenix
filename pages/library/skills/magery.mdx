Magery skill is the most usefull skill in the whole game, mainly used for casting spells such as: Recall, Gate Travel, Protection, Bless ... (there are 64 Spells placed in 8 circles). For casting spells you need a spellbook & scrolls, reagents and mana, mana is an energy which depends on your Intelligence (50 int = 50 mana) every circle takes different amount of mana (from 4 to 50), once you cast a spell and lose your mana, you can regenerate by using Meditation skill, without Meditation skill mana regen very slowly. Scrolls can be found in Monster Loot or bought from Scribe NPC and all possible scrolls can be created by Inscription skill. The scrolls have two types of use, first you can just double click the scroll to cast a spell, it doesn't require any reagents, but then your scroll have just one use, after you cast a spell its scroll dissappears. Second way is placing a scroll inside Spellbook and it stays there permanently, you can cast unlimited amount of this spell now, but you need the reagents, you'll find the reagents at NPC Mages, Alchemists or you can harvest them (at least 50% Lumberjacking skill needed). As new player you should buy full spellbook from other players/vendors, it's much easier at the beggining, full spellbook costs about 20k gp, an empty spellbook can be found at Scribe NPC vendor. To make your spells stronger you should have also Evaluating Intelligence skill. And the last part, Magery skill lets craft Magic Items, at least 80% of the Magery mixed with Tinkering lets craft randomly magic jewels and with Tailoring magic clothes.

Note: Having more Magery makes your spells stronger, same goes with Evaluating Intelligence.

HOW TO TRAIN

0-33%	Vendor Train
33-50%	Teleport
50-60%	Recall
60-70%	Incognito
70-87%	Reveal
87-97%	Polymorph
97-100%	Resurrection

This is the best way of training, if you are training only Magery and you don't need Resisting Spells or Healing skills, the spells will not hurt you, so there is no need to heal. If you're looking for guide how to train Magery and Resisting Spells together, check Resisting Spells section.

ALTERNATIVE WAY

0-33%	Vendor Train
33-50%	Any Spell from Third Circle
50-60%	Any Spell from Fourth Circle
60-70%	Any Spell from Fifth Circle
70-87%	Any Spell from Sixth Circle
87-97%	Any Spell from Seventh Circle
97-100%	Any Spell from Eighth Circle
