# Armor Infusion

armor infusion is now in game and working…..what that means is, you mine morphite meteorites….smelt into ingots….then craft platemail…..you hunt dungeons to find the fusion stone from random monsters all over the map….then you can fuse magic jewels into your armor…you cannot stack jewels(6X resist), you cannot infuse more than one piece, and after 6 uses, the stone disappears and you will have to find another….you can also wear normal jewels with the infused armor, but once again, not of the same skill….enjoy!
